This is a quick and dirty place that you can get a bowl of hot noodle. They used to make pull noodles in front of the shop. They since had discontinued that but they noodle is still pretty good. Not as good as before. 

They will have stire fried dishes also. Expect to sit with strangers when it's busy.
