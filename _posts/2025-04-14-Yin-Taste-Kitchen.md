Owned by a Singaporean married to his Cambodian wife. My personal favorites are Char Kway Teow, Laksa and Bak Kut Teh. Don't missed out asking for the spicy fish otar (the Singaporean drier version of Fish Amok). You can buy back the cold-packed fish otar; steam it and fry it at home.  My wife likes to add it into home-made fried rice.
